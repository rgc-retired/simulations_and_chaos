## Topics from Chaos

Topics from the book *Chaos: Making a New Science*, 1987, by James Gleick,
ISBN 0 14 00.9250 1.  This book is the one that really started all the
hype about Chaos.  Maybe not as famous as the Mandelbrot set, but a major
best-seller.

The topics include:

* The Butterfly Effect
* Revolution
* Life's Ups and Downs
* A Geometry of Nature
* Strange Attractors
* Universality
* The Experimenter
* Images of Chaos
* The Dynamical Systems Collective
* Inner Rhythms
* Chaos and Beyond

A few good drawings of a Mandelbrot and some Julia Sets.

Extensive bibliography.
