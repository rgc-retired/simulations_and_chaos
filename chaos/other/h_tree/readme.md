This is an example of Turtle graphics making a drawing of a curve
filling line of fractal "H" patterns.  Code was directly copied
from the Web page.  I modified the speed to 10 (5 was painfully slow).
I experimented with setting the fractal depth to 4 which gives a
much better filling of the plane but returned it to 3 for now.
The run-time for depth=4 is about 4X that of depth=3.

Sort of cute.
